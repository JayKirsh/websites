      <span class="first-letter">I</span> am in the Great Sahara Desert and boy is it hot. Quigly and I analyze fastidiously a sun-bleached map of the stars. The sun dwindles like a breath of fresh air to an emaciating candle wick, suppressed lower and lower until light ceases to spout forth. We impress the locations of the spots on the page to memory. We hope to find some pattern that will guide us like a lantern through this vast terrain.

      "Travelling in the night is right." Quigly spurns these words as a jockey to speed his horse. "The moon will not give spite."

      It started eight days ago when I arrived in Malilla on the boat from Malaga. The sun hit me like a judgement as I stepped onto the gangplank. A bit about Morocco:

      Morocco has a population of over 33.8 million and an area of 446,550 km2 (172,410 sq mi). Its capital is Rabat, and the largest city is Casablanca. Other major cities include Marrakesh, Tangier, Tetouan, Sale, Fes, Agadir, Meknes, Oujda, Kenitra, and Nador. A historically prominent regional power, Morocco has a history of independence not shared by its neighbours.

      Since the foundation of the first Moroccan state by Idris I in 789, the country has been ruled by a series of independent dynasties, reaching its zenith under the Almoravid and Almohad dynasty, spanning parts of Iberia and Northwestern Africa. Marinid and Saadi dynasties continued the struggle against foreign domination, and Morocco remained the only North-African country to avoid Ottoman occupation. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Alaouite dynasty, the current ruling dynasty, seized power in 1666. In 1912 Morocco was be divided into a French and Spanish protectorates, with an international zone in Tangier, and regained its independence in 1956. Moroccan culture is a blend of Arab, indigenous Berber, Sub-Saharan African, and European influences.

      Morocco claims the non-self-governing territory of Western Sahara as its Southern Provinces. Morocco annexed the territory in 1975, leading to a guerrilla war with indigenous forces until a cease-fire in 1991. Peace processes have thus far failed to break the political deadlock.

      Morocco is a constitutional monarchy with an elected parliament. The King of Morocco holds vast executive and legislative powers, especially over the military, foreign policy and religious affairs. Executive power is exercised by the government, while legislative power is vested in both the government and the two chambers of parliament, the Assembly of Representatives and the Assembly of Councillors. The king can issue decrees called dahirs which have the force of law. He can also dissolve the parliament after consulting the Prime Minister and the president of the Constitutional court.

      Morocco's predominant religion is Islam, and the official languages are Arabic and Tamazight. Moroccan dialect, referred to as Darija, and French are also widely spoken. Morocco is an influential member of the Arab League and a part of the Union for the Mediterranean. It has the fifth largest economy of Africa.

        <span class="author">Justine Jewels</span> is a world class traveller and Instagrammer that you should keep tabs on.
        After achieving her phd in English from <em>The University of Victoria</em>, she captained a fleet of swashbuckling sailors from <em>Victoria</em>, <em>British Columbia</em> to <em>Charlottetown</em>, <em>Prince Edward Island</em> with many tall tales wrought on her journey throughout the Americas.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since then, she has travelled across every continent this vast world has to offer, and has been verified to have some of the most ageless poses in her selfies. Jewel's latest and greatest autobiography, <em>Life as a Legend</em>, is out of stock at <em>Jutlotus Publishing</em> but new copies are expected to be churned out in the early 2022s to meet skyrocketing demands.
