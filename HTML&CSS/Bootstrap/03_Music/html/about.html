      <p>Despite the fact that Super Castlevania IV was released to the North American market four years before I was born, it would serve as my initial inspiration to write music when I was finally capable of playing it in the early 2000s. It continues to stand out to me as containing one of the most fitting soundtracks that I have had the pleasure of listening to and it remains as my basis on how to compose tracks that complement both the atmosphere and vibes given by an image.</p>

      <p>One day – a couple years after I began my compositional journey – merely out of genuine curiosity, I scoured the internet for the most difficult piano piece that was ever penned. Lo and behold I struck gold by uncovering what would be my favourite composer for time unknown: Franz Liszt. Although Liszt has been commonly criticized for saturating his works with an abundance of notes, I observed that when a piece of his was intended to portray something of high energy, there would be a positively correlating quantity of notes to represent it (such as mimicking the playfulness of will o' wisps in <em>Feux Follets</em>). This thought would be one of many that gradually shifted my musical axioms from organizing pieces through logic to painting them with emotion.</p>

      <p>Recently the compositional quality of my original chiptunes has improved to the point where it is no longer the severest limiting factor in my ability to produce audio. Thus most of my focus has been swapped to developing mixing and mastering techniques: partly inspired by the phenomenal soundtracks of the Shovel Knight collection crafted by Jake Kaufman. Towards this goal, the palette of sounds that I can draw from will constantly broaden, resulting in closer approximations when I convert sounds from my imagination into audio.</p>

      <p>Once I become adept at general sound design, I plan to formally study ideas within harmony, counterpoint, a variety of musical structures, and everything else under the compositional sun. Afterwards, I will accrue an expertise for FM (Frequency Modulation) synthesis, as it contains a diverse range of sounds that cannot be concocted by most other chips. At any rate, I look forward to the day that I emerge with a mastery over such topics.</p>
